# Prop Scout — Backend API Reference

Base URL (production): `https://<your-railway-domain>`  
Base URL (local dev): `http://localhost:3001`  
All responses are JSON. All game-level endpoints accept a `gamePk` (MLB integer game ID).  
All responses include an `X-Cache: HIT | MISS` header.

---

## Authentication
No API key required for data endpoints. Auth endpoints use JWT (see `/api/auth`).

## Odds & Props

### `GET /api/odds`
Today's MLB game lines (moneyline, total, runline) from DraftKings, FanDuel, Caesars, BetMGM.  
Shared server cache — **20 minutes**. Does not burn quota on repeat calls.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "map": {
    "New York Yankees|Philadelphia Phillies": {
      "awayML": "+108", "homeML": "-128",
      "total": "8.5", "overOdds": "-110", "underOdds": "-110",
      "awaySpread": "+1.5", "awaySpreadOdds": "-170",
      "homeSpread": "-1.5", "homeSpreadOdds": "+142",
      "book": "DK",
      "books": {
        "DK":  { "awayML": "+108", "homeML": "-128", "total": "8.5" },
        "FD":  { "awayML": "+106", "homeML": "-126", "total": "8.5" }
      }
    }
  },
  "eventIdMap": { "New York Yankees|Philadelphia Phillies": "abc123eventid" },
  "remaining": "380",
  "used": "120",
  "fetchedAt": "1:04:22 PM"
}
```

---

### `GET /api/player-props/:gamePk?eventId=<oddsEventId>`
Sportsbook player prop lines (K, TB, H, HR) for a specific game.  
Shared server cache — **10 minutes** (2 min if no props posted). Pass `eventId` from `/api/odds` to skip an extra lookup.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "gamePk": 716463,
  "reason": "ok",
  "props": [
    {
      "player": "Gerrit Cole",
      "market": "pitcher_strikeouts",
      "marketLabel": "K",
      "line": 7.5,
      "overOdds": "-115", "underOdds": "-105",
      "book": "DK",
      "books": {
        "DK":  { "line": 7.5, "overOdds": "-115", "underOdds": "-105" },
        "FD":  { "line": 7.5, "overOdds": "-118", "underOdds": "-102" },
        "CZR": { "line": 8.0, "overOdds": "+100", "underOdds": "-120" },
        "MGM": { "line": 8.0, "overOdds": "+105", "underOdds": "-125" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**`reason` values:**  
- `"ok"` — props found  
- `"no_props"` — event found on Odds API but no prop markets posted yet  
- `"no_event"` — game not found on Odds API (props not yet listed)

**LINE INTELLIGENCE (sharp vs square signal):**  
The `books` object enables cross-book line comparison. Sharp books (DK, FD) set more accurate lines than square books (CZR, MGM). A gap ≥ 0.5 between the sharp average and square average is a meaningful edge signal.  
- Gap ≥ 0.5 → base 55% confidence + 10% per 0.5 gap, capped at 80%  
- Example: sharp avg 7.5, square avg 8.0 → gap 0.5 → 65% edge confidence

---

### `GET /api/weather`
Current weather for a single stadium via Open-Meteo. Cached **1 hour** server-side.

Query params: `lat`, `lon`, `tz`, `hour`, `key` (cache key, e.g. stadium name).

**Response:** `{ temp, windspeed, winddirection, weathercode, precipitation_probability, relativehumidity, fetchedAt, cached }`

---

### `POST /api/weather/batch`
Batch weather fetch for multiple games in a single call. Used by the iOS app instead of per-game requests. Cached **1 hour** per stadium server-side.

**Request body:**
```json
[
  { "gamePk": 716463, "lat": 39.9061, "lon": -75.1665, "tz": "America/New_York", "hour": 19, "key": "Citizens Bank Park" }
]
```

**Response:** `{ [gamePk]: { temp, windspeed, winddirection, weathercode, precipitation_probability, relativehumidity, fetchedAt } }`

Dome stadiums should be excluded from the request body — the mobile client sets a hardcoded dome result for them.

---

### `GET /api/slate-bundle`
**Mobile-optimised aggregation endpoint.** Returns schedule + odds + per-game NRFI + per-game weather in a single response, replacing ~15–30 individual requests per session on a full slate.

Query params: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD, defaults to today in Honolulu time).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "schedule":   [ /* same shape as GET /api/schedule */ ],
  "oddsMap":    { "Away|Home": { /* same shape as GET /api/odds map entries */ } },
  "nrfiMap":    { "[gamePk]": { "awayFirst": {}, "homeFirst": {}, "lean": "NRFI", "confidence": 64 } },
  "weatherMap": { "[gamePk]": { "temp": 72, "windspeed": 9, "winddirection": 220, "weathercode": 2, "precipitation_probability": 5, "relativehumidity": 58 } },
  "fetchedAt":  "2026-05-19T18:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- `oddsMap` is keyed by `"Away|Home"` team name string (same format as `GET /api/odds`).
- Dome stadium games have `weatherMap[gamePk] = null` — client applies its own dome result.
- Bundle TTL: **5 minutes**. Each sub-component uses its own cache, so upstream calls only fire on individual cache misses.
- Any component failure (odds API down, weather unreachable) is non-fatal — that key returns `null` in the response.

## AI Analysis

### `POST /api/props/:gamePk`
Generates 3–5 AI prop recommendations for a game using Claude + live web search.

      "propType": "K",
      "lean": "OVER",
      "positive": true,
      "confidence": 72,
      "reason": "Cole's 10.8 K/9 against a lineup with 26% team whiff rate meets Hernandez's tight zone (19.2% K rate) and a pitcher-neutral park — line of 7.5 is beatable given his 8.7 K avg over last 3 starts."
    }
  ]
}
```

**propType values:** `K` | `Total` | `NRFI` | `F5` | `Outs` | `RL`  
**lean values:** `OVER` | `UNDER` | `NRFI` | `YRFI` | `OVER F5` | `UNDER F5` | `AWAY -1.5` | `HOME -1.5`

    { "num": 2, "away": 0, "home": 2 }
  ]
}
```

---

### `GET /api/boxscore/:gamePk`

  },
  "home": { ... }
}
```

---

### `GET /api/daily-card`
Full-slate AI analysis card for today's MLB games. Uses Claude Sonnet to surface the 2–3 strongest plays across all games after analyzing every available signal.

**Rate limits:**
- Max **10 uncached calls per calendar day** (resets midnight Honolulu) — ~$1.50/day safeguard
- Cached **45 minutes** — all users share one result per window
- Returns `429` with `{ error, cap }` when daily cap is reached

**Response:**
```json
{
  "date": "2026-04-21",
  "card": "1. BEST BETS SUMMARY\n- ...\n\n2. PICK BREAKDOWN\n...",
  "gamesAnalyzed": 15,
  "generatedAt": "2026-04-21T14:32:10Z",
  "tokens": { "input": 4800, "output": 980, "estCost": "0.0291" },
  "cap": { "date": "2026-04-21", "calls": 3, "remaining": 7 }
}
```

**Card sections (always in this order):**
1. `BEST BETS SUMMARY` — ranked list of top plays
2. `PICK BREAKDOWN` — one block per pick: `PROP`, `CONFIDENCE`, `EDGE`, `SIGNALS`, `RISK`, `PLAYABILITY`
3. `PASSES` — plays considered but rejected, with reason
4. `OFFICIAL CARD` — final plays, one per line: `Player — Market — Line — Direction — Confidence`

> Analysis rules applied silently: min 2 independent signals, unconfirmed lineup lowers batter prop confidence, missing umpire lowers K prop confidence, avgIP < 5.0 blocks K overs, bad lines noted in PLAYABILITY only.

### `GET /api/ai-board/edges`
Returns today's pre-scored Predict candidates written by the daily AI snapshot job. Reading this endpoint **never** triggers an Anthropic call — all scoring happened server-side at 10 AM HST and again ~95 min before first pitch.

**Query params:**
- `date` (optional, `YYYY-MM-DD`) — defaults to today Honolulu. Use for debugging prior runs.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "corey-seager-k-2025-05-20",
      "market": "k",
      "playerName": "Corey Seager",
      "team": "TEX",
      "gameLabel": "TEX @ HOU",
      "score": 72,
      "simConfidence": 68,
      "bookLine": 1.5,
      "edge": 0.14,
      "aiScore": 77,
      "aiReason": "Corey Seager posts 34% K rate vs. RHP with two strikeouts per game in last five."
    }
  ],
  "generatedAt": "2026-05-20T23:04:11Z",
  "slateDate": "2026-05-20"
}
```

If no snapshot has run yet today, returns `{ "edges": [], "generatedAt": null, "fallback": true }`.

**Caching:** 5-minute in-memory TTL. Snapshot updates at most twice daily (10 AM HST + pregame).

---

## Picks

### `POST /api/picks`
Logs a new pick for the authenticated user.

**Auth:** required

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "playerId": 592450,
  "playerName": "Aaron Judge",
  "market": "hr",
  "side": "OVER",
  "bookLine": 0.5,
  "odds": "-130",
  "units": 1,
  "slateDate": "2026-06-07",
  "gameLabel": "NYY @ PHI",
  "source": "board"
}
```

**Response (success):** `201 { ok: true, id: 42 }`

**Response (duplicate):** `409 { error: "already_logged", id: 42 }`

Duplicate detection is keyed on `(userId, playerId, market, slateDate)`. A second tap on the same card returns the existing pick's `id` rather than creating a new row.

---

### `GET /api/picks?days=N`
Returns picks for the authenticated user.

**Auth:** required

**Query params:** `days` — `0` returns all-time; `7` returns last 7 days; `30` returns last 30 days. Defaults to `0`.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "picks": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "playerId": 592450,
      "playerName": "Aaron Judge",
      "market": "hr",
      "side": "OVER",
      "bookLine": 0.5,
      "odds": "-130",
      "units": 1,
      "slateDate": "2026-06-07",
      "gameLabel": "NYY @ PHI",
      "resultHit": true,
      "actualStat": 1,
      "gradeStatus": null,
      "pnl": 0.77,
      "voided": false
    }
  ]
}
```

`resultHit` is `COALESCE(picks.result_hit, board_card_snapshots.result_hit)` — the frontend grading engine writes to `picks.result_hit` directly; the board snapshot provides a fallback.

---

### `GET /api/picks/stats?days=N`
Returns aggregate record stats for the authenticated user.

**Auth:** required

**Query params:** `days` — same as `GET /api/picks`.

**Response:**
```json
{ "wins": 14, "losses": 9, "pending": 3, "hitRate": 0.609, "totalPnl": 4.23 }
```

`pending` count excludes voided, PPD, scratch, and push picks. `hitRate` excludes pending/push/ppd/scratch. `totalPnl` uses vig-adjusted calculation when odds are present, flat units otherwise.

---

### `PATCH /api/picks/:id/void`
Marks a pick as voided and removes it from the active picks list.

**Auth:** required

**Response:** `{ ok: true }`

Void is only permitted before a game starts, or for PPD/SCRATCH edge cases. Once a game is LIVE the Void button is hidden in the UI, but the endpoint itself does not enforce this — it is a UI-level guard.

---

### `PATCH /api/picks/:id/grade`
Writes a grading result directly to the picks table. Called by the frontend grading engine after a game goes final.

**Auth:** required

**Request body:**
```json
{ "resultHit": true, "actualStat": 9, "gradeStatus": null }
```

- `resultHit` — `true` (hit), `false` (miss), `null` (unresolved)
- `actualStat` — the raw stat value used to grade (e.g. `9` for 9 strikeouts)
- `gradeStatus` — `"ppd"` (postponed/cancelled), `"scratch"` (player did not play), `"push"` (exact line), or `null` (standard hit/miss)

**Response:** `{ ok: true, resultHit: true, actualStat: 9, gradeStatus: null, result: "hit" }`

Also writes legacy `result` text field (`"hit"` / `"miss"`) for backwards compatibility with existing pick rows.
